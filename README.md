2. Make sure your repository settings are configured to use GitHub Pages:
   - Go to Settings > Pages
   - Set the source to "GitHub Actions"

## Google Spreadsheet Integration

This website fetches product data directly from a public Google Spreadsheet without requiring any API keys or backend services.

### How It Works

1. The products are stored in a publicly accessible Google Spreadsheet
2. The website fetches the CSV export of the spreadsheet directly from the client-side
3. The data is parsed and displayed in the products section of the website

### Updating Products

To update the displayed products:

1. Edit the Google Spreadsheet at: [Dui Konna Products](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1MQ4AnjWUty_uyNj-Z2vlW3y3IwsLrb1xAuYIThgXC5M/edit?gid=0#gid=0)
2. Ensure the spreadsheet has the following columns:
   - ID: A unique identifier for the product
   - Image URL: The URL of the product image
   - Name: The name of the product
   - Description: A short description of the product
   - Price: The price in Bangladeshi Taka (à§³)

The changes to the spreadsheet will be reflected on the website immediately when users reload the page.
